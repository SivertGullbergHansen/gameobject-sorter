Repo for my tool The Gameobject Sorter

Installation:

Press the green button at the top-right corner of this repo.

Extract the .zip-file and place the objectSorter.cs in a new folder called "Editor" in the "Assets"-folder of your project. If you do not place this script in a folder called "Editor", then unity will try to build your game with the editor-script active, which will not work.

The editor should automatically add the tool, and you will see "Tools" in the titlebar of unity.
